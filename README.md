Encrypt and Decrypt files using python

I am using cryptography library to encrypt a file, this uses a symmetric algorithm to encrypt the file.

Fernet module - has inbuilt functions for the generation of the key, encryption of plain text into cipher text, and decryption of cipher text into plain text using the encrypt() and decrypt() methods.
It also guarantees that data encrypted using it cannot be further manipulated or read without the key.

## Installation of the library

pip install cryptography
